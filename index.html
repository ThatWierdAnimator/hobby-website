        <h2>Background:</h2>
        <p>Your Only Move is Hustle is a fighting game developed by Ivy Sly in 2023. What sets it apart is that it is <strong><em>turn based</em></strong>. Whenever a player can input a new move, the game will <strong>pause</strong> and let them think before choosing a move. Instead of having to react and learn inputs, YOMI Hustle players focus solely on <strong>prediction</strong> and <strong>poking</strong> skills. When the game is finished, it plays back in <strong>real time</strong>, without pauses, and looks real cool.</p>

        <h2>Characters:</h2>

        <p>The characters currently in the game are:
            <ul>
                <li>Ninja</li>
                <li>Cowboy</li>
                <li>Wizard</li>
                <li>Robot</li>
                <li>Mutant</li>
            </ul>
            Every charcter is very <strong>unique</strong>, and has something that sets it apart from the crowd. <em>Not every character is made equal</em>, however, so some have a <strong>steeper learning curve</strong> than others. The most beginner friendly to complicated chracters are as follows:
            <ol>
                <li>Cowboy</li>
                <li>Ninja</li>
                <li>Mutant</li>
                <li>Robot</li>
                <li>Wizard</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Cowboy:</h2>
        <p>The Cowboy is a cowboy with a sword, lasso, revolver, and teleport at his disposal. Cowboy is the <strong>first character</strong> new players should pick up, as they have the safest movement option in the game, <strong><em>teleport</em></strong>. Teleport moves very quickly, only <strong>needing only a few frames to use</strong>, and can move a player <strong>very far</strong> in a <strong>controlled</strong> and <strong>unpredictable</strong> way. Since this is <em>almost immediate</em>, Cowboy players can use this to <strong>escape combos</strong> or to <strong>keep their combos going</strong>. Their normals are very fast and easy to understand, making him the best character to pick up first.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>In conlusion, while YOMI Hustle may be complicated at first, it is a very unique take on the fighting game genre, and <strong><em>extremely fun</em></strong> once you know your stuff. It is my personal favorite fighting game, and deserves the <em>Most Banger Award</em> for 2024. <br><br> Thanks for reading.</p>
